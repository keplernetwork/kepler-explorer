* Kepler-Explorer

Kepler-Explorer is the first block explorer for the [[https://kepler-tech.org][Kepler]]
blockchain. This is the source code for the instance running at 
[[https://keplerexplorer.net]].

I hope it provides a useful service for anybody interested in Kepler and to its
development.

** License

kepler-explorer is licensed under the terms of the GNU AGPL 3, see the file 
[[LICENSE]] for details. Basically it allows you to use and modify this code as 
long as you make all changes available under the same terms. The easiest way to 
do this is to fork this repo (publically!) and deploy your instance from
that repo.p

** How to setup your own instance

*** Requirements

Python >= 3.5 and PostgreSQL >= 9.3 are required.

Kepler is required to run as an archival node and basic auth needs to be disabled
in its REST API. Set `archive_mode = true` and comment out `api_secret_path` in
`kepler-server.toml` respectively.

*** Installation

Start PostgreSQL. Note that the following is just an example to run PostgreSQL,
you should ensure you use your own user and credentials when setting it up.

#+begin_src sh
sudo postgresql-setup --initdb
sudo systemctl start postgresql
sudo -u postgres -i
# psql
postgres=# \password postgres
Enter new password:
Enter it again:
postgres=# CREATE USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'mypass';
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE mydb;
postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydb to myuser;
postgres=# \q
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
#+end_src

Start `kepler-explorer`. Again, ensure you use your own credentials for Django.

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/keplernetwork/kepler-explorer
cd kepler-explorer
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# SECRET_KEY is required by Django
export SECRET_KEY=somesecretkey
# PostgreSQL configuration
export DB_NAME=mydb
export DB_USER=myuser
export DB_PASSWORD=mypass
export DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
export DB_PORT=5432
python3 ./keplerexplorer/manage.py migrate
python3 ./keplerexplorer/manage.py runserver
#+end_src

*** Import blockchain

#+begin_src sh
python3 ./keplerexplorer/manage.py import_from_tip http://127.0.0.1:13413
#+end_src
